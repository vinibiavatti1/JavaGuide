Classes
- This section explains what classes are in Java and their role in object-oriented programming.

Overview
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- It defines fields (state) and methods (behavior).
- Supports core OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Key Characteristics
- Fields store data or state.
- Methods define operations or behavior.
- Constructors initialize new instances.
- Access modifiers control visibility (public, protected, package-private, private).

Usage
- Classes model real-world or conceptual entities.
- They group related data and behavior in a single unit.
- Serve as the foundation for inheritance and interface implementations.

Example:
- The example shows a class declaration that defines a new reference type in Java using the "class" keyword.
- The main method shows how we create instances (objects) of our class using the "new" keyword.
