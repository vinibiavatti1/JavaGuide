 * Design Patterns (GoF)
 * - This section introduces the concept of Design Patterns, specifically those cataloged by the Gang of Four (GoF),
 *   which provide general, reusable solutions to common problems in software design.
 *
 * Overview
 * - Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software engineering.
 * - They are not finished code, but templates or guidelines to structure your code more effectively.
 * - The Gang of Four (GoF) are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, who published the
 *   seminal book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" in 1994.
 * - GoF patterns are widely recognized and form the foundation for many object-oriented design practices.
 *
 * Key Characteristics
 * - Reusability: patterns provide proven solutions that can be adapted across projects.
 * - Abstraction: patterns encapsulate concepts and relationships without specifying concrete implementations.
 * - Communication: patterns give a common vocabulary for developers to discuss design choices.
 * - Maintainability: using patterns often results in code that is easier to modify and extend.
 * - Categorization: GoF patterns are divided into three main types:
 *   1. Creational Patterns – concerned with object creation mechanisms.
 *   2. Structural Patterns – concerned with object composition and relationships.
 *   3. Behavioral Patterns – concerned with communication between objects and responsibility.
 *
 * GoF Design Patterns
 * - 1. Creational Patterns
 *   - Abstract Factory
 *   - Builder
 *   - Factory Method
 *   - Prototype
 *   - Singleton
 * - 2. Structural Patterns
 *   - Adapter
 *   - Bridge
 *   - Composite
 *   - Decorator
 *   - Facade
 *   - Flyweight
 *   - Proxy
 * - 3. Behavioral Patterns
 *   - Chain of Responsibility
 *   - Command
 *   - Interpreter
 *   - Iterator
 *   - Mediator
 *   - Memento
 *   - Observer
 *   - State
 *   - Strategy
 *   - Template Method
 *   - Visitor
 *
 * Usage
 * - Apply patterns to solve common design problems without reinventing solutions.
 * - Choose patterns that fit the problem context and the complexity of your system.
 * - Creational patterns simplify and standardize object creation.
 * - Structural patterns improve the composition and relationships between objects.
 * - Behavioral patterns help manage interactions and responsibilities between objects.
 * - Using design patterns can improve readability, maintainability, and scalability of your software.
 *
 * Notes
 * - Patterns are guidelines; they should be adapted to your specific use case, not followed blindly.
 * - Familiarity with GoF patterns is essential for designing robust and extensible object-oriented software.
 * - Many modern frameworks and libraries internally use these patterns, so understanding them helps in using and
 *   extending such tools.
